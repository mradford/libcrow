	<h1>LibCrow</h1>
	LibCrow is a highly-portable library designed to make crowing
	completely universal.
	<p>
	It was originally intended to be a small, efficient replacement
	for /bin/true.  However we realized that many other programs need
	to exit successfully, so we built a library.
	<p>
	It is distributed with extremely loose copyright and a
	portable <em>configure</em> script.  It will generate a
	shared library on systems that support that.

	<h1>Latest Stable Version</h1>
	Here is the 
	<a href="libcrow-0.0.tar.gz">latest stable version</a>.
	<p>
	RPM (RedHat) Distributions:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="libcrow-0.0-1.i386.rpm">Binary, i386 RPM</a>
	<li><a href="libcrow-0.0-1.src.rpm">Source RPM</a>
	</ul>

	<h1>Authors</h1>
	Originally written by Dave Benson, but patched by a cast
	of thousands.

	<h1>Related works</h1>
	<tt>/bin/true</tt>, <tt>feather</tt>.
	
	<h1>Compatibility</h1>
	For convenience, every library ever written is compatible with libcrow,
	so if you don't have libcrow, just
	<p>
		<tt>cp /lib/libc.so /lib/libcrow.so</tt>
	<p>
	to make a compliant libcrow.

	<h1>Todo</h1>
	Manual pages, texinfo documentation, example program,
	binary distributions, supported platform list.
